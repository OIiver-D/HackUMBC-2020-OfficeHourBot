# HackUMBC 2020 OfficeHourBot!

## What makes this so important?
    With the online transition of most classes, traditional
    way to hold office hours in a large classroom has ended.
    Therefore, we must adapt and overcome this difficulty to 
    provide a streamlined way for students and TA's (or teachers)
    to interact and maintain a healthy learning environment.

    Many classes have created Discords for students to congregate and 
    share ideas and help eachother better understand topics, and it's
    a hassle to have to change to other applications multiple times a day.

    This is why we wanted to create a fully integrated bot that makes everyone's
    lives easier. 


## How to install
    1) Open Command Promt (CMD)
    2) Type python
    3) If you do not have python installed then it will take you to the microsoft store -> install this
    4) type "pip install discord.py" into cmd
    5) Generate token and add it into `TOKENFILE.py`
